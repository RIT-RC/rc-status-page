## Maintenance Windows

Create an issue and tag it `maintenance`. The issue body needs to have:

```
<!--
start: 2021-02-24T13:00:00.220Z
end: 2021-02-24T14:00:00.220Z
expectedDown: <site_one>, <site_two>, ...
-->
```

Look at issue tags to see options for `expectedDown`.

Issue will automatically close at the `end` timestamp.
